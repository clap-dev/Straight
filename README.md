    This repository contains every unpacker that I've released <i>publically</i>. It also serves as a fun hobby-project I can work on in my free time.
</div>

## Usage
Each unpacker is different, but they should all be generally easy and straight-forward to use.

```bash
python main.py -f examples\obf.py
```

## Unpackers
- Simple-Obfuscator
- FunnyProtector

## To-Do
- [ ] Clean up CxFreeze, Pyinstaller, and Py2Exe unpacker with code reconstructor
- [ ] Create unpacker for https://github.com/caturmahdialfurqon/encrypt-python3

## Contributing
Requests are welcome, please open an issue first with an example of the obfuscated script (any paste site works).
