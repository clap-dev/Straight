# Straight

This is a list of all the unpackers that I've released publically.

## Usage
Each unpacker is different, but they should all be generally easy and straight-forward to use.

```bash
python main.py -f examples\obf.py
```

## Unpackers
```bash
- Simple-Obfuscator
```

## To-Do
```bash
- Clean up CxFreeze unpacker and code reconstructor
- Clean up Pyinstaller/Py2Exe unpacker and code reconstructor
```
